# weather-website
This is a weather website where I utilized a weather API. I've implemented features like a loader and a dynamically updating chart. I invite you to familiarize yourself with the code and the webpage, which can be found at the provided link. Design is based on figma project from this link: https://www.figma.com/community/file/1251834695057905718
